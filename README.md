In this study we explore the mathematical foundation, the calibration, and we assess the performance of the Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV) model, which is a variation made by
Gatheral, of the Fractional Stochastic Volatility (FSV) process, originally proposed by Comte and
Renault in 1998. The difference between the two concepts lies in the value given to the Hurst exponent (H); in the former it is assumed to be smaller than 1/2, by contrast, in the latter it is higher than
that. We propose a two-measure calibration where the Hurst parameter is assumed to be a structural
property of the underlying process therefore it is estimated statistically under the P measure, as in
Gatheral. The other parameters are then found with respect to the Q measure, in order to obtain a set
of coefficients able to price derivatives under the risk-neutral setting. We then assess the goodness of
the fit by various metrics and by comparing it with the classic Heston model, the standard for stochastic volatility. In the final part we give a small application of our model by pricing two path-dependent
exotic options.
